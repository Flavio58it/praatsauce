- Replace all Matrix-based storage with vector/array (since Praat finally has
  a real vector data type, hooray)
- Load Pitch objects (if they exist) to reduce amount of time spent on
  (possibly redundant) pitch calculations
- add option to use Mannell (1998) for formant bandwidth calculation
- add option to allow user to select autocorrelation or cross-correlation pitch estimation methods, along with associated parameters
- completely revist structure: currently we are re/saving objects over and over again (Formant objects at least) each time we find an interval
  to process. The object reference scheme should be completely revisited
